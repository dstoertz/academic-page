#Include a cool picture.

I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at St. Olaf College in Northfield, MN.

As an educator, something something student-centered, learning from mistakes.

As a researcher, something something Complex Dynamics and Quasiregular Dynamics, and the Geometry and Topology associated therewith. Baby Mandelbrot sets and mappings with multiple independent critical orbits.

The fractal images on these pages were generated using [Dynamics Explorer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/detool/) (a.k.a. detool), created by Brian and Suzanne Boyd.
